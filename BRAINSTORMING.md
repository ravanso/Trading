# Brainstorming - Trading Project Ideas

## Purpose
This document captures all general ideas, concepts, and brainstorming notes for the trading project.

## Date: October 28, 2025

## Key Questions to Address

### Trading Approach
- What markets will we trade? (Stocks, Crypto, Forex, Futures, Options)
- What timeframes? (Intraday, Swing, Position trading)
- Manual, Semi-automated, or Fully automated?
- Discretionary or Systematic?

### Core Objectives
- Primary goal: Income generation, learning, research, portfolio management?
- Risk tolerance level
- Capital allocation strategy
- Expected time commitment

### Technology Stack
- Programming language(s)
- Data providers
- Execution platforms
- Infrastructure (local, cloud, VPS)

## Core Project Direction

### Primary Focus: Options Trading with AI Agent
**Confirmed Decision:** We will focus on options trading using an AI-powered trading agent.

**Key Components:**
1. Options market focus (calls, puts, spreads, etc.)
2. AI/ML trading agent that learns and adapts
3. Strategy development and optimization

## Ideas and Notes

### Idea 1: AI-Powered Options Trading Agent
**Description:**
Build an intelligent trading agent that uses machine learning to identify profitable options trading opportunities. The agent should learn from market data, adapt to changing conditions, and execute trades based on learned patterns.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Analyze options chains (Greeks, IV, OI, volume)
- Identify high-probability setups
- Manage risk dynamically
- Learn from past trades
- Adapt strategies based on market conditions

**Potential Approaches:**
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) - Agent learns through trial and error
- Deep Learning - Pattern recognition in market data
- Ensemble methods - Combine multiple models
- Hybrid approach - ML + rule-based strategies

**Pros:**
- Can process vast amounts of data quickly
- Learns from mistakes and improves over time
- No emotional trading decisions
- Can monitor multiple opportunities simultaneously
- Backtestable and optimizable

**Cons:**
- Requires significant data for training
- Risk of overfitting to historical data
- Options markets can be less liquid
- Complex to build and maintain
- Needs robust risk management

**Next Steps:**
- Research RL frameworks (Stable-Baselines3, Ray RLlib)
- Define the agent's state space and action space
- Collect options data for training
- Design reward function
- Start with paper trading environment

### Idea 2: Strategy-Specific Agents
**Description:**
Instead of one general agent, develop specialized agents for different options strategies (e.g., credit spreads agent, iron condor agent, volatility trading agent).

**Pros:**
- Simpler to train and optimize
- Can focus on specific market conditions
- Easier to understand and debug
- Can run multiple agents in parallel

**Cons:**
- More agents to maintain
- May miss cross-strategy opportunities
- Increased complexity in orchestration

**Next Steps:**
- Identify top 3-5 options strategies to implement
- Prioritize based on risk/reward and data availability
- Design agent architecture for each strategy
