# Technical Architecture

## Purpose
Document the technical architecture, system design, and implementation approach for the trading system.

---

## System Overview

### High-Level Architecture
```
[Data Sources] -> [Data Pipeline] -> [Storage] -> [Strategy Engine] -> [Execution] -> [Monitoring]
```

### Components
1. **Data Pipeline** - Collect, clean, and store market data
2. **Strategy Engine** - Implement and run trading strategies
3. **Backtesting Framework** - Test strategies on historical data
4. **Execution System** - Send orders to broker
5. **Risk Management** - Monitor and enforce risk limits
6. **Monitoring & Logging** - Track system health and performance
7. **Dashboard** - Visualize performance and positions

## Data Pipeline

### Data Collection
**Frequency:** Real-time / Minute / Daily

**Process:**
1. Connect to data source
2. Validate incoming data
3. Transform and normalize
4. Store in database
5. Trigger strategy calculations

**Error Handling:**
- Retry logic
- Fallback data sources
- Alert on failures

---

## Strategy Engine

### Design Pattern
- [ ] Event-driven
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] Hybrid

### Strategy Execution Flow
```
1. Data Update
2. Calculate Indicators
3. Generate Signals
4. Check Risk Limits
5. Execute Orders
6. Update Positions
7. Log Results
```

### Strategy Configuration
- Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
- Parameter optimization
- Strategy versioning

---

## Backtesting Framework

### Requirements
- Historical data replay
- Realistic slippage and commission modeling
- Multiple strategy support
- Portfolio-level backtesting
- Walk-forward analysis
- Monte Carlo simulation

### Output Metrics
- Total return
- Sharpe/Sortino ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate
- Trade distribution
- Equity curve

---

## Execution System

### Order Management
**Order Types:**
- Market
- Limit
- Stop
- Stop-limit
- Trailing stop

**Execution Logic:**
- Pre-trade risk checks
- Order routing
- Fill confirmation
- Position reconciliation

### Paper Trading
- Simulated execution environment
- Validate strategies before live trading

---

## Risk Management Module

### Real-time Monitoring
- Position sizes
- P&L tracking
- Exposure limits
- Stop loss monitoring

### Automated Controls
- Auto-flatten on loss limits
- Position size adjustment
- Emergency shutdown

---

## Monitoring & Logging

### Logging Strategy
- Application logs
- Trade logs
- Error logs
- Performance logs

**Log Storage:** Files / Database / Cloud (CloudWatch, etc.)

### Alerting
**Channels:**
- Email
- SMS
- Telegram/Discord
- Dashboard notifications

**Alert Types:**
- System errors
- Trade executions
- Risk limit breaches
- Strategy signals

---

## Dashboard & Reporting

### Real-time Dashboard
**Metrics:**
- Current P&L
- Open positions
- Account balance
- Risk metrics
- Recent trades

**Technology:**
- Streamlit
- Dash/Plotly
- Custom web app (Flask/FastAPI)

### Reports
- Daily performance summary
- Weekly strategy review
- Monthly portfolio analysis

---

## Infrastructure

### Development Environment
- Local machine
- Version control (Git)
- Testing framework (pytest)
- CI/CD pipeline

### Production Environment
- [ ] Local machine
- [ ] VPS (like QualiaAI infrastructure)
- [ ] Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Hybrid

**Infrastructure as Code:**
- Docker containers
- docker-compose for orchestration
- Kubernetes (if scaling)

### Deployment Strategy
- Manual deployment
- Automated deployment
- Blue-green deployment
- Rolling updates

---

## Security Considerations

### API Keys & Credentials
- Environment variables
- Secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never commit to version control

### Access Control
- Authentication
- Authorization levels
- Audit logging

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Backup strategy

---

## Scalability & Performance

### Performance Requirements
- Data processing latency: __ ms
- Order execution latency: __ ms
- Concurrent strategy capacity: __

### Optimization Strategies
- Code profiling
- Database indexing
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Async/parallel processing

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- End-to-end workflow

### Backtesting
- Validate on historical data
- Out-of-sample testing

### Paper Trading
- Live testing without real money
- Performance validation

---

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Implement data pipeline
- [ ] Create database schema
