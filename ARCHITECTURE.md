## System Overview

### Project Focus: AI-Powered Options Trading Agent
This system uses machine learning (Reinforcement Learning) to train an intelligent agent that trades options strategies.

### High-Level Architecture
```
[Options Data Sources] -> [Data Pipeline] -> [Storage] -> [AI Agent] -> [Execution] -> [Monitoring]
                                                             ^              |
                                                             |              v
                                                         [Training] <- [Backtesting]
```

### Core Components
